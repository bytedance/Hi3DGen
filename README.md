Hi3DGen target at generating high-fidelity 3D geometry from images using normal maps as an intermediate representation. The framework addresses limitations in existing methods that struggle to reproduce fine-grained geometric details from 2D inputs.

## News
**[April 13, 2025]** ðŸš€ Hi3DGen v0.1 Released! ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ Hi3DGen-MV is still under training, we expect to release it by April 20th. Model Offloading for compatible 8 GB GPU memory is expected by April 17th.
